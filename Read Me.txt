In this folder are two programs that calculate the Collazt sequence written in C for Uman interview test.

1. "Collatz_Simple.exe": This program is optimized for simplicity and low memory usage.

2."Collatz_Recursive.exe" This Program is optimized for performance by using recursion to calculate the Collatz sequence,
 thus more memory is used than in main.exe but a reduction in CPU time gained.
